# Caller List and Details App

## Motivation:
This was a simple API calling application test. However, I took the opportunity to use this project as an entry point into learning React Redux. This project uses basic React Redux principles to create a caller list and and also has the option to view further details about each caller. I also converted everything into TypeScript just to practice more typescript and make the code more typed.



## Screens:
This is the main page listing all callers from the API:

This is the details page for a caller:

## Challenges: 
The boilerplate code was outdated, and required a lot of modification and the CSS was difficult to work with as well, causing me to remove all the boilerplate and just try my own CSS. 

## Further Changes:
If I had more time, I would add the archived feature and then make details a modal, and clean up the CSS to make it more beautiful.
